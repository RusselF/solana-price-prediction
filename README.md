# Solana Price Prediction Using BiLSTM

This project focuses on predicting Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency prices
using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network.
Historical market data is retrieved dynamically from Yahoo Finance
via the `yfinance` library, and the entire machine learning pipeline
is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Source
- Yahoo Finance (Ticker: SOL-USD)
- Data accessed programmatically using `yfinance`

## Methodology
- Time series analysis
- Data normalization using MinMaxScaler
- Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) architecture
- Train-test split based on chronological order
- Performance evaluation using RMSE and MAPE

## Model Architecture
The BiLSTM model is employed to capture both past and future temporal
dependencies in the Solana price time series, which is particularly
useful for modeling complex and volatile cryptocurrency markets.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- yfinance

## Notes
This project is developed for academic and educational purposes.
Due to the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets,
the predictions generated by this model should not be interpreted
as financial advice.
