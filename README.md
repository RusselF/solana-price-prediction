# Solana Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project aims to predict Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency prices using
historical market data retrieved from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`).
The entire machine learning pipeline is implemented in a single
Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

## Data Source
- Yahoo Finance (SOL-USD) via `yfinance`

## Methodology
- Time series analysis
- Data normalization using MinMaxScaler
- LSTM-based deep learning model
- Evaluation using RMSE and MAE

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- yfinance

## Notes
This project is intended for academic and educational purposes.
Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and predictions may not
reflect real market behavior.
